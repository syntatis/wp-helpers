The following functions are included in this package:

| Function            | Description                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `is_plugin_updated` | Checks whether the plugin is updated.         |

add_action('upgrader_process_complete', function (WP_Upgrader $upgrader, array $hookExtra) {
    if (is_plugin_updated($hookExtra, 'plugin-name/plugin-name.php')) {
        // Perform actions after the plugin has been updated.
    }
});
```
